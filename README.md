# Personal OS

A small single-page Personal Operating System: goals, metrics, 12-week plans, checklist, and a subtle animated pastel background.

Contents:
- `index.html` — main UI
- `style.css` — styles and animated background
- `app.js` — frontend logic, localStorage persistence
- `debug.html` — stronger background debug view
- `serve.sh` — helper to run a local static server

Quick start

```bash
# from project root
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser
```
